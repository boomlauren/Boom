                    </a>
                </div>
                <p>Technology has always facinated me, but i never imagined i'd dive deep into web development and
                    cybersecurity. My journey started with curiousity, turned into a passion, and is now shaping my
                    future
                    career.In this post, i'll share how i got started, the challenges i faced, and whatg keeps me
                    motivated.
                </p>
                <h3>How It All Started</h3>
                <p>Like many self-taught developers, my journey began with an interest in how websites work. I was
                    always curious about how social media platforms, e-commerce stores, and personal blogs function
                    behind the scenes. This curiousity led me to explore <b>HTML,CSS, and Javascript</b> the building
                    blocks of the web.</b></p>
                <p>I started by watching YouTube tutorials, reading blog posts, and experimenting with simple projects.
                    The first time successfully built a basic webpage, i felt an incredible sense of accomplishment-it
                    was like unlocking a new superpower!</p>
                <h3>Diving Into Cybersecurity</h3>
                <p>As i learned more about web development,I realized that security is just as important as design and
                    functionality. Cyber threats are everywhere, and i wanted to understand how to protect websites and
                    users from attacks. That's when i decided to study Cybersecurity at <b>Ladoke Akintola University of
                        Technology (LAUTECH).</b></p>
                <p>Understanding concepts like encryption, penetration testing, and ethnical hacking opened my eyes to
                    the vulnerabilites in the digital world.Now, i not only build websites but also ensure they are
                    secure from potential threats.</p>
                <h3>Challenges I faced</h3>
                <p>Like any learning journey, mine wasn't smooth.Here are some of the biggest challenges i faced and how
                    i overcame them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Information Overload - </b> There's so much to learn in web development and cybersecurity
                            that it
                            can feel overwhelming, I tackled this by focusing on one concept at a time and building
                            projects to reinforce my knowledge.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Imposter Syndrome - </b> At times, I doubted my abilites, especially when i compared
                            myself to more experienced developers. I overcame this by <b>staying consistent and
                                reminding myself that progress matters more than perfection. </b> </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Balancing Multiple Interests - </b>Juggling web development, cybersecurity, music, and
                            social media management hasn't been easy. I learned to manage my time better by setting
                            priorities and creating a structured learning plan.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What Keeps Me Going</h3>
                <p>The tech world is constantly evolving, which means there's always something new to learn. That
                    excites me! I'm passionate about helping businesses grow online, securing digital platforms, and
                    exploring creative ways to integrate technology with my other interests, like music.</p>

                    <h1>How I Balance Web Development, Cybersecurity, and Social Media Management</h1>
                </a>
                <p>Juggling web development, cybersecurity, and social media management requires a mix of time
                    management, focus, and adaptability. Here's how I do it:</p>
                <h3>1. Prioritizing Tasks</h3>
                <p>I divide my time based on urgency and importance. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Mornings - </b> Web development tasks like coding and debugging.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Afternoons - </b> Cybersecurity research and practice.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Evenings - </b>Social media management (content creation, analytics).</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Leveraging Tools & Automation</h3>
                <p>To stay efficient, I use:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Web Development - </b>VS Code, GitHub, Figma for UI designs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Cybersecurity - </b>Wireshark, Burp Suite, and ethical hacking tools.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Social Media - </b> Buffer, Hootsuite, and analytics tools for scheduling.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>3. Continuous Learning</h3>
                <p>The tech world evolves fast, so I dedicate time weekly to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Web Development:</b>Learning new frameworks (React, Tailwind CSS).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Cybersecurity: </b> Practicing ethical hacking and securing websites.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4. Staying Organized</h3>
                <p>I use Notion, Trello, and Google Calendar to plan my workflow, ensuring I don't mix up deadlines or
                    miss key tasks.</p>
